***This project is currently semi-functional. Downloads and uploads have not yet been integrated into the interface, but its API endpoints are now available..***

Powerhouse is a modern and customizable PHP-based file distribution program.

## Themes
Without any theme to use, Powerhouse will look extremely terrible, and basic functionality is extremely limited. Powerhouse relies on a theme to provide a working interface.

Theoretically, a user can even replace the `/interface` folder with their own custom interface. However, this is discouraged unless you trust the creator of said interface.

By default, Powerhouse uses a modified Google Material theme. This modern yet simple look makes it easy to use no matter which user.

## Files
By theory, you could delete every file except `.htaccess`, `const.php`, and `env.php` and every folder except `api` and `system`, and Powerhouse will still work fine.

The interface mostly depends on the API, so as long as the skeletal files and folders exist, Powerhouse will still work.

This opens up the opportunity for anyone to create their own Powerhouse interface as a fork of the project. So, go ahead and do it better than me if you can!

## Contributing
Although I'm still building the entire project, you can see what the folders are for in [the repository guide](https://github.com/ChlodAlejandro/powerhouse/blob/master/WHAT-IS-THIS-FOR.md).

## Technical
Powerhouse was built and tested exclusively on PHP 7.3.1 (x86, thread safe) using Apache 2.4 on a Windows system. It may not work for other instances of PHP as of now.

Powerhouse aims to be compatible no matter what operating system the webserver is installed on.
