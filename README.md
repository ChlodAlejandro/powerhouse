## Contributing
Although I'm still building the entire project, you can see what the folders are for in [the repository guide](https://github.com/ChlodAlejandro/powerhouse/blob/master/WHAT-IS-THIS-FOR.md).

## Technical
Powerhouse was built and tested exclusively on PHP 7.3.1 (x86, thread safe) using Apache 2.4 on a Windows system. It may not work for other instances of PHP as of now.

Powerhouse aims to be compatible no matter what operating system the webserver is installed on.
