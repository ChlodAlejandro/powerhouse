## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report vulnerabilities, please send an email to [powerhouse@chlod.net](mailto:powerhouse@chlod.net) citing the summary of the problem, along with how to reproduce the issue. Please also specify the configuration of your Powerhouse installation, along with its version.

Reports are usually seen as soon as anyone on the team is available to read the email. Active times are around 12 AM to 4 PM UTC. As soon as your message has been read and received, a response acknowledging your report will be sent. The team will then work on a fix and provide a release as soon as possible. Please note that this may take a while to fix, so don't expect a speedy resolution, although we do aim to provide such.
