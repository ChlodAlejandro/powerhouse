#`i`
`i` is the catch-all directory used for making folder navigation easy. When opening a folder from the index page, all subsequent requests will be forwarded to `i`.

## Why `i`?
`i` was supposed to mean index, but then I remembered that this was a file manager. `i` kept its name.

## Can I move `i`?
If you want to use some other shorthand path, rename this folder into whatever path you want. If you're bringing `i` into a subdirectory, make sure to modify the relative `env.php` reference inside of `index.php`.

Aside from that, also change the shorthand variable, which can be found on your `env.php` file.
